## Setting up the environment

Our environment:
* Ruby 2.5.3
* Rails 5.2.2
* PostgreSQL 11.1

## Run the project locally

After installing all the required technologies pointed in the block above. You need to execute the
following commands, each one in a different terminal:

* `SCOUT_DEV_TRACE=true rails s` (execute Puma server along with scout gem to measure requests duration)
* `node server.js` (execute the server for nodejs)
* `./bin/webpack-dev-server` (execute webpacker)
* `bundle exec sidekiq` (execute sidekiq for background jobs)

## Branch naming convention
Please use one of these four prefixes for branch names: `feature/`, `test/`, `refactor/`, and `bug/`

- Go to `config/environments/development.rb` file and change:
```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :local
```
to

config.active_storage.service = :cloudinary
```

#### WhatsApp (Karix)
In order to use the WhatsApp integration in development mode with Karix, you need to follow the next steps:

- Sign up and download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
- Exec `./ngrok http 3000`
- Sign up on [Karix](https://www.karix.io/)
- Set in the retailer that you use for testing these two attributes in the database: `karix_account_uid={your Karix ACCOUNT ID}`, and `karix_account_token={your Karix ACCOUNT TOKEN}`. These two values can be found in your Karix dashboard after signing up|in.
- Edit your Retailer and update these two attributes: `whats_app_enabled` set to `true`, and `karix_whatsapp_phone` set to the sandbox phone number provided and specified in the Karix Dashboard, let's say `+13253077759`, for instance
- In your Karix dashboard, put the following URL in the text input besides the button `Edit Webhook URL` and click it later, `https://[your ngrok subdomain].ngrok.io/api/v1/karix_whatsapp?account_id={your Retailer ID}`

- To join your Karix sandbox account, you have to send a whatsapp message, to the number saved in the past step, with the text indicated in your Karix dashboard, for example, something like this: `join generic-crayfish`. In general, that's the structure of the message, what changes between accounts is the last part of it, i.e: `join xxxxx-xxxxxx`. You should receive an answer with the text that you are already part of the sandbox.

#### Create ML test users
A real ML account has some limitations like:
- Your products can be bought
- You have a buy number limit
- You will need to use multiple emails to create them

To create some test users follow these steps:
- Get your own [Access Token](https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ec/en_us/authentication-and-authorization#token)
- Open your term and write:
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
'{
  "site_id": "MEC"
}'
https://api.mercadolibre.com/users/test_user?access_token=[Your access_token]
```
Response should be something like:
```json
{
  "id": 120506781,
  "nickname": "TEST0548",
  "password": "qatest328",
  "site_status": "active"
}
```

##### Considerations
When working with test users, you need to take into account the following considerations (more info [here](https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ec/en_us/start-testing)):

    You can create up to 10 test users with your mercadolibre account.
    Test users won’t be active for too long, but once they expire, you can create new ones.
    List under the “Others” category as much as possible.
    Never list under “gold” or “gold_premium” so it doesn’t get to our home page.
    Test users can only operate with test items: Test users can only buy, sell, and make questions on test items.
    Test users showing no activity (buy, ask, publish, etc.) during 60 days are immediately removed.
    Test items are removed regularly.
